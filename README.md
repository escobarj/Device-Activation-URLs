# Device Activation URLs

It's frustrating how often my various streaming devices (AppleTV (2nd and 3rd gen), Amazon Fire Stick, and Roku Streaming Stick) prompt me to activate access to channels. So to make life a little simpler for me, I began collecting the activation URLs here. This way I can have this page ready to access on my phone, and make activation a little less painful.

These URLs work for me on my devices, ymmv.
